## Introduction
Key problems to be asked for every project:
1.  What challenges & problems do we solve? Why is it important?
2.  How does the proposed method work to solve these challenges? What are the differences from previous works?
3. What are the insights or contributions of the proposed work to the research community?
### Problem & Key Challenges
Current approaches still have problems with:
- Current work in multimodal affective computing focuses on the emotions that are synthesized by the video, rather than the emotions that the video conveys and elicits.
- 
### Contributions
- **Dataset:** DNSV dataset
  - Our 

## Motivation
**A reasonable motivation is extremely important.**

Will focus on introducing new methods to solve the key challenges. Current ideas might include:
